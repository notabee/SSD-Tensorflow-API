1. The reason to use multiple anchor boxes is so that we can cover objects with different ratio, for example a car and a man in a feature map cell, they both have different width to height ratios which can not be covered by a single ratio anchor box.

2. Not really as we have packets of mostly same size on the shelves, they rarely have a massive change in the ratios, so one ratio anchor box is enough.
