For data preparation, we have 2 folders with cropped square images (one for training and one for evaluation). We also have 2 dataframes with information about packs places on each image. We then convert everything to train.record and eval.record files that could be consumed by Tensorflow Object Detection trainer.
The detection network used is ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640.

Parameters are mentioned in the config file.
